                                    <h4><span style="color:#8B4513">We stayed at Villa Nima for one week and had a fantastic holiday. The house itself is beautiful and the views from all the balcony's alone are worth the trip. The children loved the pool and stayed in the water most of the time. Inside the house everything was more than we expected, sometimes when you find things on the internet it doesn't quite live up to what you expected but in this case the pictures and the description can't show you how nice it actually is. The kitchen was so well equipped and the welcome pack was a wonderful surprise, the beds were so comfortable, the air-conditioning worked so well and everything was nice and clean. You will need a car to get around a little bit, but there are great beaches close by, and you have everything else you need in a walking distance, like supermarkets, tavernas etc. We couldn't ask for anything more for a holiday and would highly recommend this to others.</span></h4>

One of the most relaxing holidays we have ever had. The villa is beautiful, the views are stunning, the islanders are so friendly and the island is so unspoilt. There are no bad reviews of this villa because there is nothing to fault. It is a real find. After trawling the internet for hours looking for the best holiday we could find, we settled on Villa Nima. Thank goodness we did. We fell in love with the wine cage in the villa (that is well stocked and you can help yourself to, just replace what you have used by the end of your stay for the next guests), so much that we have ordered the exact same one. Would I recommend Villa Nima to friends? Definitely. Would I return to Villa Nima? Yes please</span>

It's a wonderful villa, built and furnished to an excellent quality with superb views. It was lovely to wake in the morning and sit on the balcony looking out over the bay below. The villa contained everything we needed to make our holiday a pleasurable experience. The villa was spotless and well maintained.<br>
<br>
It's a 5 to 10 min walk from the village which contains several excellent tavernas and three mini markets which had a large range of items.<br>
<br>
Tony and Hazel were very responsive to emails regarding the booking of the villa. We also had a helpful visit on our second day from Angela (the Managing Agent) who gave us advice on what to visit and where various amenities could be found.<br>
<br>
We hired a car to enable us to tour the island as this was our first visit to Kefalonia.<br>
<br>
We would highly recommend Villa Nima.</span></h4>

The day we arrived and unlocked the front door we straight away saw the stunning views of the bay and every day I woke up I could see the same view. The villa was equipped with everything you could possibly need and Angela (the Property Manager) was lovely and extremely helpful and arranged for us to have Viva (Greek Chief - which we recommend) to come in and cook for us for the same amount as a trip to a local taverna. It was amazing and so was Viva! which was superbly cooked by Viva.&nbsp;The meal was very good and the cheese caked was out of this world. Thank you Tony and Hazel for allowing your villa to be used, we certainly reccommend it for a very relaxing holiday. We would also recommend Approdites for a meal out. </span></h4>

The villa is excellent accommodation and exactly as described on the site, set in beautiful grounds with stunning views, The many balconies, swimming pool and barbecue area perfect for relaxing and having fun. Internally the accommodation is spotlessly clean and well equipped, The kitchen has every utensil you could wish for but with so many good taverna's in the area, I expect this area is never used to it's full potential. We were also impressed with the detail to the smaller items such as plenty of coat hangers in spacious wardrobes and soft towels and bedding. The villa is within easy walking distance to various taverna's and supermarkets but would recommend a car to view the island and it's many beautiful places. The weather was still lovely and warm for late September but cooler in the evenings once the sun went down.<br>
<br>
This trip we were introduced to the 'Preview' Taverna at the top of Auithos beach, here we enjoyed excellent food, company and once again stunning views as it is right next to the beach, being made to feel very welcome where nothing was to much trouble. The impressive Melissani Lake and Drogaratis Cave is worth visiting but you will need to be fit enough to climb the many stairs to the cave. Argostolli is well worth visiting, in the morning's you can buy your fish direct from the fishermen on their boats, you may also be lucky enough to see the turtles swimming close by, where they often come up around the boat area's.<br>
<br>
We had a really great time and would recommend the island and villa </span></h4>

What more can I say, Villa was fantastic and exactally how it was described on the site. Everything you wanted was stocked and Tony and Hazel were very kind and supplied us with a travel cot and baby high chair for our little one. Kefalonia is a fantastic Island and this is a great villa to see the sites without being in a busy town. It is set in a tranquil setting and the only thing you hear in the morning is the Cockeral crowing and the goats being moved to a new pasture.<br>

The accommodation was excellent, spacious, spotlessly clean, well equipped, beautifully decorated and comfortable. The villa had a relaxing atmosphere and gave stunning views across the bay, where we were able to watch beautiful sunsets in the evenings.<br>
<br>
The villa is well situated though I feel a car would be a bonus to view the many beauty spots the island has to offer. Within walking distance to the villa are various well stocked supermarkets, Lourdata beach and resturants of which La Mer is very good.<br>
<br>
Some of the lovely places worth visiting are Argostoli, Agia Efimia, Sami, Skala and its beach also Mytos beach. The island is so pretty you won't be disappointed, we found many small isolated, lovely beach areas along the coast to stop and enjoy, which would be ideal for a picnic.<br>
<br>
The fishing boats in Argostoli are really something to see and you can buy their days catch direct from the boats, if you are really lucky as we were you will get to see the turtles swimming around searching for food.<br>
<br>
We ate at some lovely places often enjoying tradition dishes, I would suggest that the restaurant Posada in the museum hotel George Molfetas in Faraklata is worth a visit, the welcome and food are excellent and there are many interesting historical items around the restaurant to view.<br>
<br>
I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend the accommodation and island to anyone.</span><strong>&nbsp; </strong></h4>

We wanted something away from the hustle of life to just completely chill out. The villa is lovely and tastefully put together. Very spacious and well equipped. Spotlessly clean with modern furnishings. The pool area is great, a nice size with plenty of loungers. The pool was always clean and regularly maintained by the Pool man early mornings.</span></span>

It felt very private, and was incredibly quiet. The village was less than a five minute walk away with half a dozen or so reasonably priced good restaurants and supermarkets. The locals were all very helpful and friendly. The closest beach a five minute drive, but there are many beautiful beaches around the island well worth an explore. Myrtos beach being a must. The island is easy to get around by car.</span></h4>

                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                    <h4><span style="color:#8B4513">Villa Nima is furnished to a high standard with everything needed for a great family holiday and it's location on the hillside with Mount Aenos towering up on one side and the olive groves and the crystal clear blue waters of the Ionian sea spread out on the other is just perfect.</span></h4>

                                    <h4><span style="color:rgb(139, 69, 19); font-size:1em; letter-spacing:0em; line-height:1.3em">The ground floor open plan layout of the villa is great, the decoration very tasteful and the air conditioning very effective. The kitchen is very well fitted out with all mod cons, although with so many good restaurants around I am afraid we didn't make best use of it. The three en suite bedrooms are all spacious, the beds were comfortable and there is plenty of wardrobe space. The terrace off the two first floor bedrooms offers a great vantage point to watch the morning ferry leave for Zante or the sun go down over the ancient hilltop Crusader castle in the distance. Outside there are plenty of seating areas, ample poolside sunbeds and two giant parasols to provide welcome shade from the midday sun. When it all got too hot a dip in the pool soon cooled us down. The water was always refreshing but never cold even at 11 o clock at night.</span></h4>

                                    <h4><span style="color:#8B4513">The villa is close to a good selection of family run tavernas, all serving excellent food, and a couple of well stocked supermarkets. The nearest of these are probably less than 500 metres away but they cannot be seen or heard from the villa so they do not disturb the peace and quiet.</span></h4>

                                    <h4><span style="color:rgb(139, 69, 19); font-size:1em; letter-spacing:0em; line-height:1.3em">In general we found Vlachata a good base for exploring all over the island. The pebbly beaches at Lourdas and Trapezaki are superb and not at all crowded even in August. If you want a beach of your own hire a self drive motor boat from Lourdas or Kateleios and take your pick. Further afield Assos is beautiful and Skala and Sami are both worth a visit and of course the world famous Myrtos beach is a must see, although that's one beach that is busy. Sadly we didn't make it up to Fiskardo, apparently the prettiest town on the island, but again it is easily within reach had we had a few more days on the island.</span></h4>

                                    <h4><span style="color:#8B4513">We had a great holiday on Cephalonia. If you looking to stay on this beautiful island then we would have no hesitation in recommending Villa Nima as the place to stay. Thank you very much Hazel and Tony.</span></h4>

Great Location! we have fallen in love with the island of Kefallonia. The villa boasts panoramic views of the sea coves and mountainous back drop. The en suite bathrooms were deluxe and all rooms were tailored to a high standard. A nice touch was the welcoming air conditioned villa with cooled beers provided in the fridge. The furnishings were of a high standard and the balconies and garden gave us time to relax and appreciate the spectacular views. Adequate towels and new bed linen were provided including a well done mid week cleaning and pool service.</span></h4>

                                    <h4><span style="color:#8B4513">We enjoyed sunset evenings dining at local tavernas within easy walking distance of the villa. Aswell as visits to Lourdas beach and numerous coves and beaches dotted throughout the island. One main road navigates you around the entire island and allows you to discover its many beauty spots and places of interest. The island is unique with its clear blue Ionian sea and surrounding greenery with breathtaking scenery is appealing to all. </span></h4>
